1. EDA Exploratory Data Analysis

1.1. Intro to Exploratory data analysis (EDA) in Python
    intro-to-eda.ipynb 
data.csv 
This data contains more of 10, 000 rows and more than 10 columns which contains features of the car such as Engine Fuel Type, Engine HP, Transmission Type, highway MPG, city MPG and many more.

2. Feature Engineering

2.1. Example - Concrete Formulations
     fe-course-1-intro.ipynb
Concrete_Data.xls
The Concrete dataset contains a variety of concrete formulations and the resulting product's compressive strength, which is a measure of how much load that kind of concrete can bear.

2.2. Example - 1985 Automobiles¶
     fe-course-2-mutual-info.ipynb
Aumobile_data.csv
The Automobile dataset consists of 193 cars from the 1985 model year. The goal for this dataset is to predict a car's price (the target) from 23 of the car's features, such as make, body_style, and horsepower. In this example, we'll rank the features with mutual information and investigate the results by data visualization.
     fe-course-2-mutual-info-ex.ipynb
ames.csv
79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa

2.3. Creating Features
     fe-course-3-creating-features.ipynb
autos.csv
accidents.csv
concrete.csv
customer.csv
     fe-course-3-creating-features.ipynb
ames.csv
79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa

2.4. Clustering With K-Means
     fe-course-4-clustering-with-k-means.ipynb
housing.csv
As spatial features, California Housing's 'Latitude' and 'Longitude' make natural candidates for k-means clustering. In this example we'll cluster these with 'MedInc' (median income) to create economic segments in different regions of California.
     fe-course-4-clustering-with-k-means-ex.ipynb
ames.csv
Add a feature of cluster labels to Ames and learn about another kind of feature clustering can create

2.5. Principal Component Analysis
     fe-course-5-principal-component-analysis.ipynb
     Example - 1985 Automobiles
autos.csv
Apply PCA, using it as a descriptive technique to discover features
          fe-course-5-principal-component-analysis-ex.ipynb
ames.csv
You'll work through several applications of PCA to the Ames dataset

2.6. Target Encoding
     fe-course-6-target-encoding.ipynb
movielens1m.csv
The MovieLens1M dataset contains one-million movie ratings by users of the MovieLens website, with features describing each user and movie
     fe-course-6-target-encoding-ex.ipynb
ames.csv
Apply target encoding to features in Ames and investigate a surprising way that target encoding can lead to overfitting.
