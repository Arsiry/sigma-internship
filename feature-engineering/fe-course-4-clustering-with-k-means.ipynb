IntroductionÂ¶
This lesson and the next make use of what are known as unsupervised learning algorithms. Unsupervised algorithms don't make use of a target; instead, their purpose is to learn some property of the data, to represent the structure of the features in a certain way. In the context of feature engineering for prediction, you could think of an unsupervised algorithm as a "feature discovery" technique.

Clustering simply means the assigning of data points to groups based upon how similar the points are to each other. A clustering algorithm makes "birds of a feather flock together," so to speak.

When used for feature engineering, we could attempt to discover groups of customers representing a market segment, for instance, or geographic areas that share similar weather patterns. Adding a feature of cluster labels can help machine learning models untangle complicated relationships of space or proximity.

Cluster Labels as a Feature
Applied to a single real-valued feature, clustering acts like a traditional "binning" or "discretization" transform. On multiple features, it's like "multi-dimensional binning" (sometimes called vector quantization).
